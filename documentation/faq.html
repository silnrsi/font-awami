    <p>A generic FAQ for all of our Arabic scripts fonts can be found

    Fonts - FAQ</a>. FAQ's specific to Scheherazade New are found
    below.</p>
    <h3 id="problems-with-bold-weights">Problems with Bold weights</h3>
    <h4
    id="why-does-my-application-not-show-the-bold-weight-in-font-menus-and-dialogs"><em>Why
    does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and
    dialogs?</em></h4>
    <p>Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold.
    To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using
    the application's UI controls such as a "B" button.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-sometimes-get-a-fake-bold"><em>Why do I sometimes
    get a fake Bold?</em></h4>
    <p>If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as ExtraLight),
    then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications
    will make a "fake" Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the
    font (Medium, SemiBold, Bold, ExtraBold). This is because only
    Regular has an associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical
    limitation with some apps and OSes. If you are using some other
    weight than Regular for text and want to make a word or phrase stand
    out you will need to select the text and apply one of the heavier
    weights manually.</p>
    <h3 id="what-is-so-special-about-awami-nastaliq"><em>What is so
    special about Awami Nastaliq?</em></h3>
    <p>This is the very first Nastaliq-style font with support for a
    wide range of languages, made possible by a flexible technology.
    This is the only freely-available font to provide an authentic
    Nastaliq style with kerned calligraphic segments.</p>
    <p>This font is designed to work with the <a
    href="https://graphite.sil.org">Graphite</a> advanced font
    technology. To take advantage of the advanced typographic
    capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that
    provide an adequate level of support for Graphite. These advanced
    capabilities provide access to the variant character forms used in
    some languages. See <a href="features.html">Font features</a> and <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/awami/what-is-special/">What is
    Special About Awami Nastaliq?</a></p>
    <h3 id="what-does-awami-mean"><em>What does Awami mean?</em></h3>
    <p>Awami is an Urdu word meaning “of the people”, “of the common
    population” or “public”. Awami Nastaliq is an Arabic script font
    specifically intended for a wide variety of languages using the
    Nastaliq style of South Asia.</p>
    <h3 id="what-characters-are-included-with-this-release"><em>What
    characters are included with this release?</em></h3>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for the full
    listing.</p>
    <h3
    id="i-notice-that-awami-nastaliq-is-missing-a-number-of-characters-that-i-would-like.-will-you-add-these"><em>I
    notice that Awami Nastaliq is missing a number of characters that I
    would like. Will you add these?</em></h3>
    <p>It is impossible for us to add every glyph that every person
    desires, but we do place a high priority on adding complete coverage
    of all the characters defined in Unicode for languages that use the
    Nastaliq style of Arabic script (excluding the Arabic Presentation
    Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use). You can
    send us your requests, but please understand that we are unlikely to
    add symbols where the user base is very small, unless they have been
    accepted into Unicode.</p>
    <h3
    id="why-isnt-this-font-shaping-properly-in-microsoft-word-or-in-indesign"><em>Why
    isn't this font shaping properly in Microsoft Word or in
    InDesign?</em></h3>
    <p>We have only implemented this font using the Graphite technology.
    You <em>must</em> be using applications which support Graphite in
    order to get the shaping. Please see the <a
    href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p>
    <h3 id="why-have-you-only-implemented-this-font-in-graphite"><em>Why
    have you only implemented this font in Graphite?</em></h3>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Graphite's basic positioning mechanisms are more powerful than
    OpenType's; but more importantly (2) Nastaliq makes extensive use of
    Graphite's automatic collision avoidance; and also (3) Graphite has
    more powerful development tools.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Should OpenType engines gain the necessary collision avoidance
    support, then we would probably add OpenType support to Awami
    Nastaliq.</p>
    <h3
    id="awami-nastaliq-does-not-have-proper-spacing-or-collision-avoidance-in-xetex.-how-can-i-get-the-promised-collision-avoidance"><em>Awami
    Nastaliq does not have proper spacing or collision avoidance in
    XeTeX. How can I get the promised collision avoidance?</em></h3>
    <p>There is a special new parameter in XeTeX to support the new
    Graphite collision avoidance. See <a
    href="resources.html">Resources</a> for help in getting that
    working.</p>
    <h3 id="why-isnt-awami-nastaliq-working-in-xelatex"><em>Why isn't
    Awami Nastaliq working in XeLaTeX?</em></h3>
    <p>Awami Nastaliq is a Graphite font. For OpenType fonts the font
    declaration would be:</p>
    <pre><code>    \newfontfamily\fontnast[Script=Arabic]{Jameel Noori Nastaleeq}</code></pre>
    <p>However, because this is a Graphite font, you need a different
    declaration:</p>
    <pre><code>    \newfontfamily\urdufont[Renderer=Graphite]{Awami Nastaliq}</code></pre>
    <p>It would also be useful to add
    <code>\XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping=1</code> to your file. Thus, you
    might have:</p>
    <pre><code>    \XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping=1
\newfontfamily\urdufont[Renderer=Graphite]{Awami Nastaliq}</code></pre>
    <h3
    id="why-doesnt-awami-nastaliq-use-agl-adobe-glyph-list-names-i-cannot-copy-and-paste-from-a-pdf-using-awami-nastaliq-into-another-document.-there-is-a-lot-of-gibberish."><em>Why
    doesn't Awami Nastaliq use AGL (Adobe Glyph List) names? I cannot
    copy and paste from a pdf using Awami Nastaliq into another
    document. There is a lot of gibberish.</em></h3>
    <p>In order to dynamically position the dots above and below the
    corresponding base forms, Awami Nastaliq separates the patterns of
    dots into their own nuqta glyphs. These nuqta glyphs have no
    possible AGL name because they do not correspond to any Unicode
    character. Therefore it is never going to be possible to extract a
    corresponding Unicode text stream from a sequence of Awami Nastaliq
    glyph names.</p>
    <p>This does not mean it is impossible to copy and paste from a PDF.
    High quality PDF creation software will include the Unicode
    character text stream within the document, which makes copy and
    paste work regardless of the glyph names used by the font.</p>
