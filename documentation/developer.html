    <p>We welcome other developers who wish to get involved in
    supporting and enhancing these fonts or who want to modify them.</p>
    <h2 id="permissions-granted-by-the-ofl">Permissions granted by the
    OFL</h2>
    <p>SILâ€™s fonts are licensed according to the terms of the <a
    href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font License</a>. The
    OFL allows the fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed
    freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. For details see
    the OFL.txt and OFL-FAQ.txt files in the package.</p>
    <h2 id="building-the-fonts-from-source-code">Building the fonts from
    source code</h2>
    <p>Font sources are published in a <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/font-awami">Github project</a>. The
    build process requires <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/smith">smith</a> and project build
    parameters are set in the <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/smith/blob/master/wscript">wscript</a>.</p>
    <p>Font sources are in the <a
    href="http://unifiedfontobject.org/versions/ufo3/">UFO3</a> format
    with font family structures defined using <a
    href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/tree/master/Doc/source/designspaceLib">designspace</a>.
    There is no OpenType code in this font, but the font does use the
    Graphite smart font technology.</p>
    <p>The fonts are built using a completely free and open source
    workflow using industry-standard tools (<a
    href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools">fonttools</a>), a
    package of custom python scripts (<a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/pysilfont">pysilfont</a>), and a
    build and packaging system (<a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/smith">smith</a>). The whole
    toolchain is available as a Docker container.</p>
    <p>Full instructions for setting up the tools and building SIL fonts
    are available on a dedicated web site: <a
    href="https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/">SIL Font Development
    Guide</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="building">Building</h3>
    <p>The Awami Nastliq project can be built from source using <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/smith">smith</a>. This is done via
    the sequence:</p>
    <pre><code>    smith distclean
    smith configure
    smith build -v -j1</code></pre>
    <p>Because of the complex kerning and collision avoidance logic,
    builds can take up to 15 minutes or longer, depending on
    hardware.</p>
    <h4 id="some-useful-smith-build-options">Some useful
    <code>smith build</code> options</h4>
    <p><code>-v</code> makes the output slightly more verbose,
    specifically including the "runner" information showing the actual
    commands smith is executing.</p>
    <p><code>-j</code> controls parallel processing. Depending on your
    machine's memory, <code>smith build</code> sometimes fails due to
    the intense computation requirements of the Awami build. If this
    occurs, <code>-j1</code> or <code>-j2</code> can be used to restrict
    parallel processing, although this slows the build process somewhat.
    The number after the <code>-j</code> indicates the number of tasks
    smith will try to do in parallel.</p>
    <p><code>-d</code> should normally be omitted when building the
    fonts. However, when developing/debugging a font using Graide, the
    <code>-d</code> must be used to prevent some optimizations that are
    incompatible with Graide.</p>
    <p><code>--regOnly</code> causes smith to build the Regular weight
    only. This is useful during development and debugging.</p>
    <h2 id="modifying-the-font">Modifying the font</h2>
    <h3 id="project-documentation">Project documentation</h3>
    <p>A good deal of developer documentation for the Awami Nastaliq
    font can be found at the <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/font-awami/documentation/developer">Awami
    GitHub repository</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="adding-characters">Adding characters</h3>
    <p>Like most Nastaliq fonts, Awami takes a "decomposition" approach,
    where initial, medial, and final forms are constructed at rendering
    time from separate base glyphs and nuqtas and other inherent parts
    of characters. This means that adding a new character will likely
    require only adding the isolate form along with its USV
    encoding.</p>
    <p>After adding new glyphs to the font, the shaping logic will need
    to be extended to handle them. The bulk of the code is found in: -
    <code>nastaliq_classes.gdh</code> -
    <code>nastaliq_cntxlClasses.gdh</code> -
    <code>nastaliq_shaping.gdh</code> -
    <code>nastaliq_rules.gdh</code>.</p>
    <p>A helpful approach is to do a global search through the code for
    a character with similar behavior and add glyphs for the new
    character in all the corresponding places.</p>
    <p>In addition, the following will need to be updated: -
    <code>glyph_data.csv</code> -- should include all glyphs in the
    font; it is used to set glyph order in the built font. -
    <code>nastaliq_complexShapes.gdh</code> -- needs to include any
    glyphs who shapes cannot be approximated by a simple polygon for the
    purposes of kerning, particularly those with concave portions. -
    "Octabox" data will need to be updated for all the weights of the
    font; see below. - <code>ftml_test_gen.py</code> -- should include
    the new character in order for it to be included in the
    automatically generated test files.</p>
    <h3 id="generating-octaboxes">Generating octaboxes</h3>
    <p>"Octaboxes" are polygons that approximate the shape of the
    glyphs; these are used for kerning and fixing collisions. There is
    an octabox JSON file for each font weight. Whenever new glyphs are
    added or glyph shapes are signficantly modified, the octaboxes
    should be regenerated.</p>
    <p>Before any octabox can be updated, the ttf file for the
    corresponding font must be in the <code>results/</code> folder, so
    you first need to build the fonts (see above). Then the command to
    update a single octabox is:</p>
    <pre><code>octalap -j 0 -q -o source/graphite/octabox_AwamiNastaliq-WEIGHT.json   results/AwamiNastaliq-WEIGHT.ttf</code></pre>
    <p>where WEIGHT is Regular, Bold, etc. As given above, the command
    must be run from the root of the project. The command must be
    executed for each weight, and each will take several minutes to
    execute.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, there is a script in the <code>tools/</code>
    folder called <code>run_octalap</code> which, if run from the
    <code>tools/</code> folder, will update all the octaboxes:</p>
    <pre><code>cd tools
./run_octalap</code></pre>
    <p>In order to use the newly generated octaboxes the font must then
    be rebuilt.</p>
    <h3 id="auto-generated-test-files">Auto-generated test files</h3>
    <p>The project includes a Python program
    <code>tools/scripts/ftml_test_gen.py</code> that can generates test
    data in a form of XML called FTML (see below). A variety of test
    files can be built, covering various combinations of base characters
    and diacritics: - <code>basicforms</code> - only one character of
    each shape class is included, no diacritics -
    <code>allbasechars</code> - all base characters, no diacritics -
    <code>basic_somediac</code> - only one character of each shape class
    with one lower and one upper diacritics - <code>basic_alldiac</code>
    - only one character of each shape class with all diacritics -
    <code>allbasecharforms</code> - all characters and diacritics are
    included (this creates a huge file!)</p>
    <p>The test file builder is called as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>python3 tools/scripts/ftml_test_gen.py</code></pre>
    <p>which generates files for all five modes, or</p>
    <pre><code>python3 tools/scripts/ftml_test_gen.py -m MODE</code></pre>
    <p>These files are not automatically generated by the build.</p>
    <h4 id="modifying-ftml_test_gen.py">Modifying
    <code>ftml_test_gen.py</code></h4>
    <p>When new characters are added to the font, they should be added
    to <code>ftml_test_gen.py</code>. - Assign the character a short
    code and associated it with the USV the
    <code>_char_name_to_usv()</code> function. - Add details about the
    character to the <code>_group_name_format()</code> or
    <code>_diac_group_name_format()</code> function. - Add the code to
    the appropriate list in the <code>expand_sequences()</code> or
    <code>insert_diacritics()</code> function.</p>
    <p><code>tools/ftml.xsl</code> can be used to view ftml documents
    directly in Firefox (which supports both Graphite rendering).</p>
    <h4 id="viewing-ftml-test-files">Viewing FTML test files</h4>
    <p>The <code>ftml.xsl</code> file is used to view the FTML files in
    Firefox. Firefox is needed to both handle the XSL transforms as well
    as provide Graphite render.</p>
    <p>However, in order for Firefox to access the .xsl file, you need
    to relax its "strict URI" policy by going to about:config and
    setting <a
    href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy">security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy</a>
    to false.</p>
    <p>Once you have this setting in effect, you can load the FTML
    documents directly into Firefox and see the built font rendered.</p>
