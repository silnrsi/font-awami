    <h2 id="about-this-project">About this project</h2>
    <p><em>Awami Nastaliq</em> is a Nastaliq-style Arabic script font supporting a wide variety of languages of South Asia, including but not limited to Urdu. This font is aimed at minority language support. This makes it unique among Nastaliq fonts.</p>
    <p>Nastaliq, based on a centuries-old calligraphic tradition, is considered one of the most beautiful scripts on the planet. Nastaliq has been called “the bride of calligraphy” but its complexity also makes it one of the most difficult scripts to render using a computer font. Its right-to-left direction, vertical nature, and context-specific shaping provide a challenge to any font rendering engine and make it much more difficult to render than the flat (Naskh) Arabic script that it is based on. As a result, font developers have long struggled to produce a font with the correct shaping but at the same time avoid overlapping of dots and diacritics. In order to account for the seemingly infinite variations, the Graphite rendering engine has been extended just to handle these complexities properly.</p>
    <p>For more information on the visual characteristics of the font see <a href="../../pdf/design.pdf">Design</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
    <p>This font is actively maintained and improved, and recent changes to its development process will enable more frequent releases.</p>
    <p>The highest priorities for future additions and enhancements are mainly driven by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>New additions to <a href="../../pdf/https://unicode.org/">The Unicode Standard</a></li>
    <li>Requests from language communities using the fonts</li>
    <li>Needs of the linguistic and academic community</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please send us your requests using the <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/awami/about/contact/">form on the font website</a>. If you are interested in helping us make the font better see the <a href="../../pdf/developer.pdf">Developer</a> page.</p>
