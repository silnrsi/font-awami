The Awami Nastaliq font does not provide complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode for Arabic script. Because the font style is specifically intended for languages using the Nastaliq style of Arabic script, the character set for this font is aimed at supporting those languages.

[Arabic (U+0600..U+06FF)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0600.pdf) was added to Unicode 1.0. [Arabic Supplement (U+0750..U+077F)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0750.pdf) was added to Unicode 4.1, [Arabic Extended-A (U+08A0..U+08FF)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U08A0.pdf) was added to Unicode 6.1, and [Arabic Extended-B (U+0870..U+089F)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0870.pdf) was added to Unicode 14.0. There are still some Arabic script characters being added to Unicode, so it is possible that not all languages using the Arabic script are fully represented in Unicode.
