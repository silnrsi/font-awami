Thank you for your interest in the Awami Nastaliq font. The Awami Nastaliq font does not provide complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode for Arabic script. Because the font style is specifically intended for languages using the Nastaliq style of Arabic script, the character set for this font is aimed at supporting those languages.

This documentation is a set of HTML pages that can be viewed in any modern web browser. PDF versions of these pages are also provided. This content, plus download links and a contact form, are available from the [Awami Nastaliq site](https://software.sil.org/awami/).
