DOCUMENTATION
Awami Nastaliq
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions in the `pdf` folder.

These are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

FYI: Since Awami Nastaliq is a Graphite-only font, the pdfs are manually created using FireFox.
