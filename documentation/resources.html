    </header>
    <p>The SIL Arabic script fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so
    your application must support Unicode text in order to access
    letters other than the standard ANSI characters. Most applications
    now provide basic Unicode support. You will, however, need some way
    of entering Unicode text into your document.</p>
    <p>Arabic script is a complex and difficult script, and this
    complexity is compounded by the fact that Arabic script is used for
    <a href="https://scriptsource.org/scr/Arab">many different
    languages</a> and cultures with variations in acceptable
    calligraphic style. From a computer perspective at least, the
    technologies used to implement Arabic script are not yet fully
    mature. The result is that while a given font might work for one set
    of languages on a given software platform, the same font might not
    work for other languages or on other platforms. This means that it
    is very difficult to give an accurate answer to the question of
    software requirements.</p>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>This font is supported by all major operating systems (macOS,
    Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that
    support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the font by decompressing the .zip archive and installing
    the font using the standard font installation process for .ttf
    (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see
    the help page on <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font
    installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and
    character set support</h2>
    <p>This font does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. If
    you cannot use the built-in keyboards of the operating system, you
    will need to install the appropriate keyboard and input method for
    the characters of the language you wish to use. If you want to enter
    characters that are not supported by any system keyboard, the <a
    href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman program</a> can be helpful on
    Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS systems.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions are listed here: <a
    href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw">Keyboard Systems
    Overview</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details
    of the Unicode characters supported by this font.</p>
    <h3 id="keyman-keyboards">Keyman keyboards</h3>
    <p><a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> provides quite a few
    keyboards for languages which use the Nastaliq style of Arabic
    script. Go to <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman.com</a>. Click on
    <strong>Keyboards</strong> and then type the language for which you
    wish to select a keyboard. It will offer you keyboard packages if
    any are available for that language.</p>

    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application
    support</h2>
    <p>The Awami Nastaliq font requires software enabled with the very
    latest <a href="https://graphite.sil.org/">Graphite</a> engine
    (version 1.3.4+) in order to render correctly. The font does not
    support OpenType rendering. <strong>It will not work with standard
    software such as Microsoft Office</strong>.</p>
    <p>Currently, the only software that can render Awami Nastaliq are
    the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox web
    browser</a>, the <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice
    suite</a>, <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">XeTeX/XeLaTeX</a>,
    and linguistic software such as <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/">FieldWorks</a>, <a
    href="https://paratext.org/">Paratext</a>, <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/ptxprint/">PTXprint</a>, and <a
    href="http://bloomlibrary.org/">Bloom</a>.</p>
    <p>If a developer wishes to add support for Graphite, the Graphite
    engine is available <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/graphite/releases/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Here are links for downloading appropriate versions:</p>
    <h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>
    <p>You will need a <a
    href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?scene=2&amp;f=85">recent
    version of Firefox</a> - version 46 or later.</p>
    <p>Due to security concerns, Graphite has sometimes been disabled in
    Firefox by default, so you might need to enable it. Follow these <a
    href="https://graphite.sil.org/graphite_firefox">instructions for
    enabling Graphite in Firefox</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="libreoffice">LibreOffice</h3>
    <p>We recommend <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice
    5.3+</a> which supports version 1.3.8 of the Graphite engine.</p>
    <p>Version 5.2 fixed the bug that was in version 5.1.</p>
    <p>Version 5.1 supports Awami, but it has a bug where certain
    characters (eg, the small tah) would be displayed in an incorrect
    position.</p>
    <h3 id="xetex">XeTeX</h3>
    <p>The TeXLive 2017 version of XeTeX contains a fix for Harfbuzz
    which was causing combining marks to clash at the end of words when
    followed by a Latin character.</p>
    <p>TeXLive is available from <a
    href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">https://www.tug.org/texlive/</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="full-collision-avoidance">Full Collision Avoidance</h4>
    <p>To use the full collision avoidance (both intra- and inter- word)
    of Awami in XeTeX (required version 0.99995 or newer) a macro
    parameter needs to be set.</p>
    <p>Explanations of this parameter are at:</p>
    <p><a
    href="http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026398.html">http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026398.html</a>
    <a
    href="http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026401.html">http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026401.html</a>
    <a
    href="http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026402.html">http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026402.html</a>
    <a
    href="http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026403.html">http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026403.html</a>
    <a
    href="http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026474.html">http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-February/026474.html</a></p>
    <p>This parameter should be set in a .tex file. The file could look
    something like:</p>
    <pre><code>    %% Cross-space contextualization

% No cross-space contextualization.
% This is how XeTeX behaves by default.
% Most projects will use this setting.
% \XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping = 0

% Some cross-space contextualization.
% Spaces between words are adjusted,
% but the rendering of individual words is not affected by the spaces.
% \XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping = 1

% Full cross-space contextualization.
% Spaces between words are adjusted,
% and the rendering of individual words is affected by the spaces.
% \XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping = 2</code></pre>
    <p>You must uncomment the appropriate command! For Awami Nastaliq,
    you will likely want to uncomment the last line
    (<code>\XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping = 2</code>). That allows the full
    support for collision avoidance.</p>
    <p>The above text (all comments and commented out statements) will
    give the same behaviour as before this feature was added to XeTeX,
    so existing users do not see any unexpected changes.</p>
    <h4 id="bidi-support">Bidi Support</h4>
    <p>XeTeX in <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeXLive 2017+</a>
    uses the latest version of Harfbuzz (1.4.6+) which fixes a bug in
    bidirectional data.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of this font (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are
    available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a
    web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS
    demo page is also included. For more information on the options and
    techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on
    Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>One common type of data conversion is from Roman script to Arabic
    script. Cross-script conversion is often very language specific.
    TECkit is one program that can be used for character encoding
    conversion. TECkit allows users to write their own custom conversion
    mappings. The TECkit package is available for download from SILâ€™s <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> Web site. The <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/silconverters/">SIL Converters</a>
    software will be an important tool in data conversion.</p>
