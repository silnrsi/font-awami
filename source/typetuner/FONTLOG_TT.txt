FONTLOG 
Awami Nastaliq font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Awami Nastaliq font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Awami Nastaliq font 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Awami Nastaliq is a Nastaliq-style Arabic script font supporting a wide variety of 
languages of Southwest Asia, including but not limited to Urdu. This font is aimed 
at minority language support. This makes it unique among Nastaliq fonts.

Awami means "of the people", "of the common population" or "public". 

The Awami Nastaliq font does not provide complete coverage of all the characters 
defined in Unicode for Arabic script. Because the font style is specifically 
intended for languages using the Nastaliq style of southwest Asia, the character 
set for this font is aimed at those languages.

This font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex 
typographic issues. Font smarts have been implemented using Graphite only. We have 
no current plans to support OpenType.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Awami Nastaliq Regular

For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Alkalami" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Alkalami. 
However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Alkalami" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Alkalami Hausa" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Alkalami" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Calamus Foo".
